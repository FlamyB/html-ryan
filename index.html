<p>If you scroll through TikTok long enough, or even any site on the Internet for that matter, you will likely come across short clips and images of the murderous protagonist of American Psycho, Patrick Bateman walking down the hallway of his office, listening to music through his headphones with a stone-cold smolder that only the facial structure of Christian Bale could pull off. These clips are often captioned with cryptic or even ridiculous advice on finance and how to treat women or situations that are meant to be relatable to awkward, shy guys accompanied by photos or clips of Bateman, Robert Pattinson‚Äôs Batman, or Ryan Gosling‚Äôs characters from both Drive and Blade Runner 2049. This advice is supposedly how ‚Äúsigma males‚Äù are supposed to act, but what does that even mean?</p>
